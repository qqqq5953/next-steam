This is a portfolio project inspired by the [RAWG](https://rawg.io/) game platform website, developed with Next.js 13, TypeScript, Shadcn, and Tailwind CSS. Currently. It recreates the Platform, Stores, Genres, Creators, Tags, Developers, Publishers, and Game detail pages. [View Portfolio](https://next-steam-nine.vercel.app/)

Disclaimer: I may continue to expand this project by adding new features, aiming to bring this portfolio closer to a fully functional gaming platform.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
