      "name": "Did anyone else think killing Floyd and Debra was just … unnecessary?",
      "text": "<p>Honestly, this is one of the plots in the story that I really disliked and made me look at Trevor a little differently, because Floyd never hurt Trevor, agreed to let him and Wade just stay with him in his girlfriend&#8217;s apartment for a long time whilst knowing Debra wouldn&#8217;t like visitors and she would be really angry at him if she found out. Besides, even if Debra was definitely not very nice I still don&#8217;t think she deserved to be killed as she was rightfully probably freaked out by Trevor just bursting into their appartement and causing a scene. It was just super unnecessary imo, and especially twisted because Trevor lied to Wade and had him believe Floyd and Debra were still alive afterwards. Not to mention that it&#8217;s implied multiple times that Trevor did some disturbing things to Floyd whilst staying with him initially.</p><p>I know Trevor is an unhinged character and he&#8217;s done worse things, but this just really put me off for some reason. Besides, I really liked the Vespucci Beach condo as a safehouse for the location and especially the interior, and I wish we could have kept it instead of having Trevor suddenly move to the Vanilla Unicorn and now have an office as a second safehouse (how random). But regardless, I wish he at least didn&#8217;t kill Floyd and Debra. (even if it&#8217;s implied on the in-game news it was actually Debra that shot Floyd and Trevor proceeded to kill her afterwards interestingly, but it still escalated because of Trevor just bursting in)</p><p>I know it&#8217;s unlikely Floyd and Debra would have let Trevor and Wade stay with them forever, but idk they could have at least found something that didn&#8217;t end in their death. Trevor could have simply picked up Wade and took him to the Vanilla Unicorn without that entire confrontation or maybe magically Floyd and/or Debra would have a change of heart if Trevor proved himself to be a reliable housemate to them.</p><p>What are your thoughts on this mission? Do you agree? Or did you think this actually fitted Trevor&#8217;s character?</p>",

      "text": "<p>Did he brainwash them?</p><p>With Wade I can sort of see Trevor adopting him after helping him get Meth for his addiction or whatever, but what about Ron? He seems like a pretty smart guy but is always insulting himself around Trevor. And they're supposed to be business partners right? It's not like he's a minion.</p>",
